# Z027: Access declaration through type instead of instance

Detects accessing struct constants or static functions through an instance when they should be accessed through the type.

## Examples

### Bad

```
// Accessing struct constant through instance
var c: Counter = .{};
_ = c.max;         // Bad: should be Counter.max

// Calling static function through instance
const p: Point = .{};
_ = p.origin();    // Bad: should be Point.origin()
```

### Good

```
// Access through the type
_ = Counter.max;
_ = Point.origin();

// Instance methods (with self parameter) are fine
var c: Counter = .{};
c.increment();     // OK - has self parameter
```

Note: This rule requires semantic analysis to distinguish instance methods from static functions.

## Rationale

Accessing type-level declarations through instances is misleading—it suggests the value depends on the instance when it doesn't. Using the type name makes it clear the declaration is static and independent of any instance.
